# Order 5 Diamond Lattice Simulation

The script `./run_server_savehists_O5_firstsuccessfulrun.jl` was used to
generate the dataset for an order 5 lattice. The script does not take in any
command line arguments, you just have to have the dependencies installed. Refer
to the top level README.md file for further information on how to do this.
